When to Use a Services Folder
External System Integrations:
If your app needs to integrate with third-party services, such as Firebase
, payment gateways, or cloud storage, you can 
create a services/ layer to abstract those o
perations.

Business Logic that Doesn't Fit Cleanly in
 Use Cases:
Some operations might not fall strictly u
nder a specific business "use case," but 
are still important parts of the app. 
Services can handle things like file uploads,
 managing app-specific background tasks, or 
 dealing with external services.

Network and API Management:
In some cases, you might place code related 
to API requests, retries, or other asynchronous
 tasks in a services/ folder. However, note 
 that when using Clean Architecture, this
  type of logic generally belongs in the data/ layer (through repositories and data sources), and services/ would be for more high-level interactions.
